Version: 0.1-0
Title: Simple querying of the Harvard Dataverse API
Description: Functions to query the Harvard Dataverse API so that we can find
  R source files uploaded to the dataverse.
  This mimics Python code in dataverse-r-study.
Author: Duncan Temple Lang
Note: I have not checked if there is a package on CRAN with the basic functionality.  
   Also, Florian Sihler told me about the dataverse-r-study.
