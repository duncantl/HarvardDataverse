# HarvardDataverse

A (currently) simple package to query the [Harvard Dataverse](https://data.harvard.edu/dataverse)
[API][https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/api/index.html], specifically the Search API.


This is for us to find R code from publications and studies so we can explore and analyze it.
This mimics the approach in the study published
[here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01143-6)
and the code in the [dataverse-r-study](https://github.com/atrisovic/dataverse-r-study.git)
