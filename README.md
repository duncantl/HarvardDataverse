# HarvardDataverse

A (currently) simple package to query the [Harvard Dataverse](https://data.harvard.edu/dataverse)
[API](https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/api/index.html), specifically the Search API.

There is an existing R package on CRAN for this - [dataverse](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-client-r).

This is for us to find R code from publications and studies so we can explore and analyze it.
This mimics the approach in the study published
[here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01143-6)
and the code in the [dataverse-r-study](https://github.com/atrisovic/dataverse-r-study.git)
